  Hi, my name is Yoon and I'm a 2nd year MS student studying Data Science at NYU. 
  My expected graduation is in May 2023, and I'm actively looking for Data Scientist opportunities after graduation.

  I've started my Data Science career by leading a machine learning project in Samsung as a finance manager.
  As I wanted to learn more about data science, I'm now pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at NYU.
  For this summer, I did a data science internship at Walmart Global Tech, and built a m/l pipeline that solved problems in e-commerce. 

  My interests, broadly, are solving real world problems with data science, and I'm especially interested in NLP/NLU.
  Please refer to Project section to find out more. 

  My current skill set includes:

  - Language: Python(including <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DdJniS3SKU--ZVSEezWZWgYtUx1QzdoM/view?usp=share_link">tensorflow</a>/pytorch), SQL, PySpark

  - Tools: GCP, MS office, Tableau, Git/Github

  If you are interested, please contact me via email or linkedin.
