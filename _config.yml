  Hi, my name is Yoon and I'm a 2nd year MS student studying Data Science at NYU.
  My expected graduation is in May 2023, and I'm actively looking for Data Scientist opportunities after graduation.
  If you are interested, please contact me via email or linkedin.  

  I've started my Data Science career by leading a machine learning project in Samsung as a finance manager.
  As I wanted to learn more about data science, I'm now pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at NYU.
  For this summer, I did a data science internship as Walmart Global Tech, and built a m/l pipeline that solved problems in e-commerce. 

  My interests, broadly, are solving real world problems with data science, and I'm especially interested in NLP/NLU.
  Please refer to Project section to find out more. 

  My current skill set includes:
    Language: Python, SQL, PySpark
    Tools: GCP, MS office, Tableau, Git/Github

# Also, I enjoy working on side projects/Datathon. I was recently placed 1st place at Citadel Regional Datathon. 
# I am very much motivated to participate in any data challenges (inclduing Kaggle). Let me know if you are interested in data challenges as well! 

# Outside of data science works, I enjoy traveling overseas and drinking coffee.

          • Created a benchmark dataset using rest of market and Walmart item information that enriched the team’s research
          • Proposed a boosting model to train the benchmark dataset that improved current category mapping performance by 35%
          • Built a machine learning pipeline that replaced the team’s deliverable which is to predict category for new items

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
